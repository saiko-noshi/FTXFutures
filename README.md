# FTXFutures
A tool to quickly calculate which futures contracts offer the biggest premiums/discounts, so one can make money with magic internet money and no market exposure with arbitrage/cash and carry trades.
Just enter the month of contracts you want to trade for.

This tool only works with FTX exchange.

### Calculations use the index price against the highest bid (for discounts) and highest ask (for premiums), so as to give a more realistic gain one can make if they were to enter by market.
